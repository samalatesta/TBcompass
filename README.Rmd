The TBebm package implements the event-based model to classify disease severity for TB patients using data collected at time of diagnosis. We include functions to estimate the model, quantify model uncertainty, and visualize results. We provide a detailed vignette that walks through an example analysis using `TBebm`. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `TBebm` from [GitHub](https://github.com/). We recommend setting the option `build_vignettes=T` when installing so the package vignette can be accessed in your local R environment. The `devtools` package must be installed prior to installing `TBebm`. 

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("samalatesta/TBebm", build.vignette = T)
```
## Usage

To use `TBebm` in your R scripts or projects, load the package using:

```R
library(TBebm)
```
For detailed information on how to use each function, please refer to the package documentation and vignette. The vignette can be viewed locally after package installation or the knitted html is also included in the `\vignettes` directory. 
```R
vignette(package="TBebm")
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for TBebm functions is available within R. You can access documentation using the ? operator followed by the function name. For example:

```R
?plot_events
```
